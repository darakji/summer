## ðŸ”§ Summary of Current Status

### ðŸ”¹ Slab Conversion & Cleanup
- All `.vasp` slabs from Canepa repo have been:
  - Renamed cleanly to reflect (hkl), termination, order
  - Converted to `.cif` and stored in `summer_llzo_cifs/`

### ðŸ”¹ Validation & Geometry Fixes
- Slabs with:
  - Thickness < 10 Ã… âœ… Skipped
  - Min bond distance < 1.4 Ã… âœ… Skipped
- Remaining slabs:
  - âœ… Centered in z-direction
  - âœ… 30 Ã… vacuum padding added
  - âœ… Stored in `summer_llzo_cifs_prepared/`

### ðŸ”¹ Physical Diagnostics
- Oxidation sum calculated using formal charges:
  - âœ… All slabs are charge neutral
- Dipole moments (z) estimated for asymmetry
  - âœ… Tagged as "Safe" or "Unsafe" in `llzo_dipole_charge_tagged.xlsx`

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- [ ] Exclude Unsafe slabs before CHGNet relaxation
- [ ] Relax slabs using pretrained CHGNet
- [ ] Prepare force/energy labels for MACE
