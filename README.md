# LLZO–Li Interface Dataset Generation (Summer 2025)

This repository contains a complete workflow for constructing high-quality interface slabs between **LLZO (Li₇La₃Zr₂O₁₂)** and **Li metal**. These are intended for use in **machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs)** and **DFT-based interface studies**.

## ✅ Final Interface Structures: `llzo_li_balanced_sliced/`

- All structures are stored in `.cif` format.
- Naming convention:  
  ```
  LLZO_{facet_or_id}__Li_{facet}.cif
  ```

**Key properties:**
- Fully matched XY dimensions
- LLZO and Li block thickness difference ≤ **20%**
- Li placed with **4 Å interfacial gap**
- **Tasker Type I surfaces** (dipole-free, stoichiometric)
- 15 Å vacuum above and below
- Atom counts: **800–1200 per structure**

---

## 🛠 Workflow Summary

### 1. `generate_li_slabs.py`

- Creates Li surface slabs along low-index facets
- Optional heavy-atom fixes and vacuum removal
- Final slabs stored in `li_slabs_fixed_heavy/`

### 2. `li_llzo_stack.py` (Main Interface Builder)

For each LLZO–Li slab pair:

- Li is **tiled in X and Y** to match LLZO lateral dimensions
- For a range of Z-repeats \(k = 1 \dots 8\):
  - Li block is stacked
  - Top part is **sliced** at LLZO thickness to ensure close match
- Final selection is based on:
  - Thickness mismatch \( < 20\% \)
  - Atom count between **800 and 1200**
  - Score function balancing both:

    \[
    \text{score} = \frac{|\Delta t|}{t_{\text{LLZO}}} + \left| \frac{N_{\text{Li}} - 1000}{1000} \right|
    \]

- LLZO is shifted to 15 Å (Z), Li stacked above with 4 Å gap
- Final cell height = top of Li + 15 Å vacuum

## 🔍 Design Considerations

- Interfaces are physically realistic and balanced
- All slabs are neutral and dipole-free
- Designed for CHGNet, MACE, DFT-FE, and MD workflows
- Atom count optimized for parallel computation
